Hello, we are a team creating innovative games to support the physical and mental well-being of astronauts.
In microgravity, astronauts face challenges that impact their health. To address this, weâ€™ve developed three interactive games: 
a virtual ping-pong game for coordination, a robotic arm challenge to enhance precision, and a space race to boost agility.

These games combine technology with fun, promoting both physical activity and mental engagement during long missions in space.
